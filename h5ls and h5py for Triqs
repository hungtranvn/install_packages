Fedora:
dnf install hdf5
dnf install hdf5-devel
pip2 install --user --no-binary=h5py h5py


https://github.com/h5py/h5py/issues/1533#issuecomment-617519250
The problem is that if one tries to install h5py from binary using
pip3 install --no-binary=h5py h5py
and the user does not have cython installed, the install process will download the latest version of cython (30 alpha1), which is not compatible with h5py as delivered by the tarball.
So in this case the solution is to install cython with
pip3 install cython
which installs version 0.29, and the install h5py.

Alternatively, one can unstall the version from the code cloned from the github. HOWEVER,
in this case make sure that you have numpy>=1.18.3, or else the library will compile, but will
crash when loaded with the following error

File "/nas/longleaf/home/XXX/.local/lib/python3.6/site-packages/h5py/init.py",

AttributeError: 'numpy.dtype' object has no attribute 'typeobj'

Apparently, the installer is satisfied with numpy version 1.7 or above, but that is clearly not enough.
